# Notes
* Some ordering for room draws could be good, similar to equipment draws, to make sure the more impressive/powerful rooms are later in the game
* Need a way to compensate for varying Room effect power-level to make you want to put them in your deck
* Master Currency: "Menace"? "Peril"? "Threat"?
* Non-hostile creatures? Diplomacy? Retreats? Information from creatures?
* Named creatures in specific rooms?
* How does trasure work?
* Keys?
* Room **slots** for occupants/treasure/items/etc for Master's consumption, go away when viewd by Champion, who just gets a narrative about the occupants of the room.
* Master can customize rooms in advance?
* Room ordering & final room
* Tutor slots on cards search up a random matching card from your deck.
* Other permanent fixture slots are cards permanently attached to the room.
* Need names for these concepts
* Rooms are drawn like equipment in a semi-random order

## Cards
* Master has a currency called "Peril"
* Cards have card **components**
  - When a card is *played*, a card is automatically generated matching each **component** on the card and put into the Master's hand (if it has a cost) or directly into play (if it does not).
* Types of components:
 - Creatures
 - Traps
 - Objects
 - Locations
 - Equipment
 - Spells
* Decks contain 3 special room cards: Start #1, Start #2, and Final
* Possible Threats: If a room has a possible thread indicator, the Master gets a discount of 2 Peril when adding the indicated type of Threat to the room.
* No treasure
* No locks
* Champion wins by clearing all rooms or 10 rooms, whichever happens first
* 10th room drawn is always final room

## Rooms
* Rooms are always played face-up, Master places Threats into them face-up
    - some threats can be played face-down as Hidden Threats, e.g. traps or ambushes
    - cost for face-down threats is paid in order to flip them
    - each Threat costs 1 per threat already in that room
* Master gains 1 mana per active room card in play during the Income step
* Champion can approach rooms in any order
* Rooms can be "active" or "cleared"
* When the Champion leaves a room it is "cleared" and flipped face-down
* Champion wins by clearing all rooms in play or by clearing 12 rooms
* Game starts with 2 active rooms
* A "standard" room has no special abilities and is affiliated with a particular House, the master gains 1 mana in that House when it's played
* A "dual" room is affiliated with two Houses, and the master does not gain Peril when it's played. It produces mana in one of the houses of his choice during the income step.
    - Often there is some other benefit to a dual room
* A "triple" room is affiliated with three Houses, does not produce mana, and never has a benefit for being played.
* Some rooms do not produce mana, but have an associated unique creature, limited number of these per deck
* Need to differentiate Master strategies
   - Factions on cards
   - Cards are neutral or associated with 1 House
* Master card Houses:
  - **Ruby**: extra big monsters
  - **Emerald**: cheap little threats, more organized, large numbers
  - **Amethyst**: spellcasters & counterspells 
  - **Sapphire**: traps & ambushes
  - **Topaz**: threat benefit effects
  - **Onyx**: champion harm effects
  - **Diamond**: master benefit effects
* All houses get creatures, rooms, traps, effects, etc as long as they carry forward the central theme
* Rooms get generated flavor text, but usually (at least for now) have no special effects of their own other than their associated Perils
