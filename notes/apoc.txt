Encounter: Gargoyle Chasm
The passage leads to a subterranean chasm spanned by a zigzagging, ten-foot-wide stone bridge without railings. The bridge links tunnels leading north and south. The chasm floor is fifty feet below the bridge and consists of a jumbled mass of boulders. To the west, the chasm narrows and continues for some distance.

Encounter: Three gargoyles guard the area, lurking in the upper reaches of the cavern. Characters with darkvision spot them with {Perception} 15 or higher.
  - They attack strangers unless they give the hand signal of the cult.
  - They look for opportunities to push charactesr off the bridge
  - If two are defeated, the third retreats to area B2 to hdie

Encounter: North Chasm
The floor of this large cavern is a broken jumble of stone, with steep walls slanting up to a ceiling of hanging stalactites perhaps a hundred feet above. Fifty feet up the jagged walls are two openings: a wider opening to the southwest and a narrow tunnel leading southeast.

Encounter: Ruined Gates
A massive pair of stone doors lies broken just south of this small plaza, flanking by iron torches that brightly illuminate the area. One door lists unevenly on its bottom hinge, and the other lies shattered on the ground. The standing door is carved with a pastoral scene of grain fields and rolling hills, worn and pitted by the centuries. A large, dimly lit hall waits beyond the broken gates. Arrow slits are carved into the west and east walls.

Encounter: Arrow Slits. Any loud commotion around the gate might attract the attention of cultists in the other areas, who will begin shooting through these slits.

Encounter: Hall of the Gate
This was once a magnificent hall with a soaring ceiling, marble floors, and intricate carvings of prosperous farmlands decorating the walls. It has since fallen to ruin. Deep cracks mar the walls, sections of the masonry have collapsed, and the huge stone doors at the north end of the hall are broken. Passages lead west and south, and there is a stone door to the east. A small cooking fire and several bedrolls are in the southeast corner of the room.

Encounter: Nartham
Four hobgoblins, a burrowshark named Nartham (see chapter 7), and Nartham’s bulette mount guard the Hall of the Gate. Nartham is a violent, short-tempered fellow. If the characters attempt to talk their way into the temple, they need to talk fast, because Nartham craves an excuse to kill.

Encounter: Reinforcements
The duergar in area B5 and the cultists in area B7 hear any battle in this room. However, they are used to Nartham’s bulette making noise, so it takes a while before they become curious about any racket. The duergar use crossbows (see area B5) while the cultists in B7 come to aid the forces here.

Encounter: East Guardroom
The crumbling masonry in this old guardroom illustrates the great age of this dungeon. To the north, a long gallery leads to an arrow slit in the western wall. To the south, piles of rubble choke a small inner chamber. Haifa dozen plain bedrolls and an iron stove furnish the room. A pile of firewood nearby keeps the stove well stoked.

Encounter: Duergar
This guardroom serves as the barracks and post of five duergar in the service of the Black Earth cult. If alerted by serious fighting or unusual activity outside, two duergar take light crossbows (+2 to hit, 1d8 piercing damage) and post themselves at the arrow slits. The other two prepare to defend the room’s only entrance.

Encounter: Yarsha's Burrow
A large pile of rubble from a partially collapsed wall fills the southeast corner of this guardroom, while a narrow fissure mars the wall to the north. Despite these failings, the room serves as a barracks and guardroom. Four plain wooden bunks are arrayed around the room, each with a small footlocker. At the back of an alcove in the northeast wall is an arrow slit.

Encounter: Yarsha
A Stonemelder named Yarsha and her two Black Earth guards (see chapter 7 for both) dwell here. In addition to normal gear, Yarsha carries a potion of greater healing, and the guards have light crossbows.

Treasure:
An iron coffer under Yarsha’s bunk contains 210 sp, 140 ep, a pouch with six obsidian flakes worth 10 gp each, and a potion of water breathing.

Encounter: Gatewarden's Quarters
This large suite consists of several small rooms linked by low archways. Brown curtains offer some amount of privacy for the different rooms, and martial displays cover the walls--shields and crossed swords, tattered banners, and a few mounted monster heads, including those of a peryton and a manticore.

Encounter: Dynath
A burrowshark named Dynath, a Black Earth guard, and four cultists occupy the room. The cultists keep odd hours, and at any given time 1d4 are sacked out in their bunks. At least two of the residents are awake even in the middle of the night. They assume that random strangers that blunder in unannounced are enemies and attack. If circumstances permit, the occupants of the room spread the alarm by alerting the cultists in area B4 to the attack.

Treasure:
Dynath wears a hidden purse underneath his armor containing 15 gp, 5 pp, and five fine citrines worth 40 gp each.

Encounter: Mud Sorcerer's Lab
Large stone statues carved to look like scowling dwarf warriors line the walls of this large chamber. Each statue has spiky maces in place of hands. However, several of the statues are melted or deformed. The flagstones in the middle of the room have been removed to reveal a surface of natural rock. Several worktables and shelves full of alchemical reagents are tucked up against the walls between the statues.

Encounter: Miraj Vizann
Miraj is rational, deliberate, and slow to anger. He supports the cult because it deepens his understanding of elemental magic. If challenged, he attempts to persuade his attackers to turn their efforts against the fire cult. Miraj isn’t above offering a bribe to entice enemies, then reneging on the deal if they come back to collect.

In battle, Miraj commands the golem to defend him. He then retreats to the back of the room to cast spells. Miraj turns invisible and flees if death seems imminent.

Treasure:
A wooden chest stowed under one of the worktables holds a small hoard of 220 gp, nine strange black crystals worth 50 gp each, and a potion of water breathing.
