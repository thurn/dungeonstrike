# Notes
* Some ordering for room draws could be good, similar to equipment draws, to make sure the more impressive/powerful rooms are later in the game

# Master Deck
* 60 Cards
* Max 4 of any kind
* Max 1 of Room cards?
* Max 3 subtypes
* Theme: Flying fortress full of cultists, built by cloud giants, mostly made out of ice

## Rooms [24]
### Main Gate
*A lowered drawbridge spans a foggy moat. Beyond it is an open portcullis.*

✮: Lower the portcullis. While it's lowered, occupants of this room can't attack and you can't take the Explore action.

✮: Raise the portcullis.

### Gate Towers

*Two towers stand above the gate, extending up into the mist.*

The Master can place Creatures into the tower, in which case they get +4 to hit rolls but cannot make melee attacks.
