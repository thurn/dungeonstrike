# Notes
* Some ordering for room draws could be good, similar to equipment draws, to make sure the more impressive/powerful rooms are later in the game
* Need a way to compensate for varying Room effect power-level to make you want to put them in your deck
* Master Currency: "Menace"? "Peril"? "Threat"?
* Non-hostile creatures? Diplomacy? Retreats? Information from creatures?
* Named creatures in specific rooms?
* How does trasure work?
* Keys?
* Room **slots** for occupants/treasure/items/etc for Master's consumption, go away when viewd by Champion, who just gets a narrative about the occupants of the room.
* Master can customize rooms in advance?

# Master Deck
