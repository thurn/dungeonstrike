# Notes
* Some ordering for room draws could be good, similar to equipment draws, to make sure the more impressive/powerful rooms are later in the game
* Need a way to compensate for varying Room effect power-level to make you want to put them in your deck
* Master Currency: "Menace"? "Peril"? "Threat"?
* Non-hostile creatures? Diplomacy? Retreats? Information from creatures?
* Named creatures in specific rooms?
* How does trasure work?
* Keys?
* Room **slots** for occupants/treasure/items/etc for Master's consumption, go away when viewd by Champion, who just gets a narrative about the occupants of the room.
* Master can customize rooms in advance?
* Room ordering & final room
* Tutor slots on cards search up a random matching card from your deck.
* Other permanent fixture slots are cards permanently attached to the room.
* Need names for these concepts
* Rooms are drawn like equipment in a semi-random order

## Cards
* Master has a currency called "Peril"
* Cards have card **components**
  - When a card is *played*, a card is automatically generated matching each **component** on the card and put into the Master's hand (if it has a cost) or directly into play (if it does not).
* Types of components:
 - Creatures
 - Traps
 - Objects
 - Locations
 - Equipment
 - Spells
* Decks contain 3 special room cards: Start #1, Start #2, and Final
* Possible Threats: If a room has a possible thread indicator, the Master gets a discount of 2 Peril when adding the indicated type of Threat to the room.
* No treasure
* No locks
* Champion wins by clearing all rooms or 10 rooms, whichever happens first
* 10th room drawn is always final room

## Rooms
* Rooms are always played face-up, Master places Threats into them face-up
    - some threats can be played face-down as Hidden Threats, e.g. traps or ambushes
    - cost for face-down threats is paid in order to flip them
    - each Threat costs 1 per threat already in that room
* Master gains 1 Peril per active room card in play during the Income step
* Champion can approach rooms in any order
* Rooms can be "active" or "cleared"
* When the Champion leaves a room it is "cleared" and flipped face-down
* Champion wins by clearing all rooms in play or by clearing 12 rooms
* Game starts with 2 active rooms
* A "standard" room has no special abilities and is affiliated with a particular Peril, the master gains 1 Peril of that type when it's played
* A "dual" room is affiliated with two Perils, and the master does not gain Peril when it's played. It produces one of his choice during the income step.
    - Often there is some other benefit to a dual room
* A "triple" room is affiliated with three Perils, does not produce Peril, and never has a benefit for being played.
* Some rooms do not produce Peril, but have an associated unique creature, limited number of these per deck
* Need to differentiate Master strategies
   - Factions on cards
   - Cards are neutral or associated with 1 House
* Master card Perils:
  - **Monstrous**: extra big monsters
  - **Legion**: cheap little threats, more organized, large numbers
  - **Arcane**: spellcasters & counterspells 
  - **Deception**: traps & ambushes
  - **Bolster**: threat benefit effects
  - **Fury**: champion harm effects
  - **Boon**: master benefit effects
* All Perils get creatures, rooms, traps, effects, etc as long as they carry forward the central theme
