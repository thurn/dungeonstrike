# Notes
* Some ordering for room draws could be good, similar to equipment draws, to make sure the more impressive/powerful rooms are later in the game
* Need a way to compensate for varying Room effect power-level to make you want to put them in your deck
* Master Currency: "Menace"?

# Master Deck
* 60 Cards
* Max 4 of any kind
* Max 1 of Room cards?
* Max 3 subtypes
* Theme: Flying fortress full of cultists, built by cloud giants, mostly made out of ice

## Rooms [24]
### Main Gate
*A lowered drawbridge spans a foggy moat. Beyond it is an open portcullis.*

✮: Lower the portcullis. While it's lowered, occupants of this room can't attack and you can't take the Explore action.

✮: Raise the portcullis.

### Gate Towers
*Two towers stand above the gate, extending up into the mist.*

Creatures can be placed into the tower, in which case they get +4 to hit rolls but cannot make melee attacks.

### Lower Courtyard
*Walls of solid ice enclose this courtyard. An opening in one wall leads to a spiral staircase made out of sculpted ice.*

Creatures can be placed on the staircase. Melee attacks made on the staircase must pass a Agility[15] check or the attack is prevented and the attacker takes 1d4 damage.

### Stables
*This place stinks of some kind of droppings and rotted flesh. Cracked bones cover the floor.*

**Treasure**: Four fine bridles are kept here, embellished with jade, worth 500 gp each.
