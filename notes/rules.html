  <h1>Game Overview</h1>
  <p>
    <i>DungeonStrike</i> is a 2 player collectible dungeon crawl card game. One player takes on the role of the <b>Champion</b>, a great warrior seeking her fortune in a dungeon filled with traps, treasure, and ferocious monsters. The other player takes on the role of the <b>Master</b>, the evil presence ruling the dungeon itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    A game of <i>DungeonStrike</i> is divided up into a series of turns, alternating between the Master and the Champion. The Master always takes the first turn. During his turn, the Master earns <b>gold</b>, can add a new <b>room</b> to the dungeon, deploy devious traps, place monsters into rooms, or have his forces attack the Champion directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the Champion's turn, she gains 4 <b>action points</b> to spend, represented by the <i class="action"></i> symbol. <i class="action"></i> can be spent to draw cards, generate <b>mana</b>, make attacks, cast spells, search for treasures, or move between rooms.
  </p>
  <h1>Object of the Game</h1>
  <p>The objective for the Master is simple: kill the Champion by any means necessary. The Champion wins the game by successfully navigating the Dungeon, winning the game if all of the rooms in the dungeon are cleared. The Champion also wins if the Master must draw a card from his empty deck.</p>
  <h1>Setup</h1>
  <p>Players decide who will be the Champion and who will be the Master. The Champion receives 4 mana to start, and the Master receives 4 gold. The Master shuffles his deck and draws 7 cards.</p>
  <p>The Champion shuffles her Spell deck and draws 5 cards. She then sorts her Equipment deck into piles by <b>equipment level</b> and shuffles each pile. She draws up to 2 cards from the level 1 Equipment deck.</p>
  <p>The Master may then elect to <b>mulligan</b> by setting aside two or more cards from his hand, drawing one less card than the number discarded, and then shuffling the set aside cards back into his deck. After the Master mulligans, the Champion can mulligan Spell cards in a similar manner. Equipment cards cannot be mulliganed.</p>
  <p>After resolving mulligans, the Champion may put the Equipment cards from her hand into  play. Finally, three starting Standard Room cards are put into play. Two are placed face-down and one is placed face-up. The face-up room becomes the first <b>active room</b>.</p>

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardType">
      Room
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Room cards are played by the Master to represent locations in the dungeon. They are normally put into play face-down and are turned face-up when the champion <b>explores</b> them. At the beginning of his turn, the Master gains gold for each room card in play.</p>
  <p>During his turn, the master can add one new Room from his hand to the dungeon complex. Room cards have a name and often have a special effect which impacts the game. For example, the "Orcish Armory" room grants a bonus to Orc creatures deployed there.</p>
  <h3>Standard Room Cards</h3>
  <div class="exampleCard roomCard">
    <div class="cardCost"></div>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Standard Room cards are room cards that always have the same effect: the Master gains 2 gold when they are revealed. The Master's deck may contain any number of Standard Room cards.</p>
  <h2>Threat Cards</h2>
    <p>During his turn, the Master may put any number of Threat cards into play. Each Threat card must be played face-down into a specific face-down Room. New Threats cannot normally be added to the Active Room. Playing a Threat card costs 1 gold per Threat already present in the Room it is being added to.</p>
  <h3>Creatures</h3>
  <p>Creatures are a specific type of Threat which can <a href="#attacks">Attack</a> the Champion directly. When the Champion enters a room, the Master may pay the costs for any face-down Creatures in the room in order to turn them face-up. Otherwise, the Master may flip face-down Creatures by paying their costs during his Reinforcements phase.</p>

  <h1>Attributes and Skills</h1>

  <h2>Dice Rolling</h2>
  <p>
  In-game instructions will occasionally use notation like "d20" or "d12". This
  notation originally referred to rolling dice, but in DungeonStrike it means to
  draw a card from a specific deck of numbered cards. The decks contain the
  following values:
  <ul>
    <li><b>d20:</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12,
    12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]</li>
    <li><b>d12:</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11,
    12]</li>
    <li><b>d10:</b> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10]</li>
    <li><b>d8:</b> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8]</li>
    <li><b>d6:</b> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]</li>
    <li><b>d4:</b> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]</li>
  </ul>
  If a deck runs out of numbers, it is shuffled before further draws take place.
  </p>

  <h2>Attributes</h2>
  <p>
      All characters in DungeonStrike have 3 common attribute scores which
      describe their ability to perform various game actions. These attributes
      are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Agility</b>, which captures the character's reflexes, dexterity,
          and speed. Characters with a higher agility have better aim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fortitude</b>, which captures the character's constitution, brawn,
          and strength. Characters with a higher fortitude have more health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mind</b>, which captures the character's intellect, charisma,
          wisdom, cunning, and knowledge. Characters with a higher mind score
          are better at a variety of skills and at resisting certain types of
          mental attacks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Attributes for characters usually fall in the 10-18 range, with 12 being a
      typical starting value. Characters can discover special "attribute bonus"
      cards which let them increase an attribute score.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some in-game effects reduce a character's attributes instead of directly
    damaging that character. This is called <b>attribute score damage</b>. Until
    the damage wears off or is removed, the character functions as if it has the
    new lower score in the indicated attribute. If any of a character's
    attribute scores falls below zero, the score is set to zero and the
    character will be unconscious and at <a
    href="#-health-unconsciousness-and-death">risk of dying</a> until the
    attribute damage is healed.
  </p>

  <h2>Attribute Checks</h2>
  <p>
  Many game situations call for an <b>attribute check</b> to resolve the outcome
  of a particular action. In order to make an attribute check, start with the
  character's attribute score and add any bonuses or penalties to the score as
  appropriate to get an <b>attribute target</b>. Finally, roll a 20-sided
  die. If the number rolled is <b>lower than or equal to</b> the attribute
  target, the result of check was success.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, a character attacking might have an Agility of 13 and may have a
  +2 bonus to hit. Adding in the bonus means the agility target is 15, so the
  character must roll 15 or less to score a hit.
  </p>
  <h2>Opposed Attribute Checks</h2>
  <p>
  Some situations involve a contest between two different characters's
  attributes. In situations like this, both characters make <b>opposed</b>
  attribute checks, with the winner being the character who passes the attribute
  target by the largest amount. For example, two characters arm wrestling would
  make opposed checks against their Fortitude attribute. The winner is the
  character whose roll is lower than their fortitude-based attribute target by
  the largest absolute magnitude.
  </p>
  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p>
  In addition to the three main attributes, there are six different skills in
  DungeonStrike that a character can specialize in. Additional ranks in a skill
  can be gained by discovering "skill bonus" cards which let the character add
  levels as desired. The six skills are:
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Athletics</b> [Fortitude]. Used to perform actions such as swimming,
    climbing, lifting heavy objects, grappling enemies, punching, kicking,
    riding, charging, or throwing.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Acrobatics</b> [Agility]. Used to perform actions such as tumbling,
    balancing, escaping from entanglements, jumping, or tripping enemies.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Mechanics</b> [Mind]. Used to perform actions such as opening locks,
    disabling traps or understanding devices.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Perception</b> [Mind]. Used to perform actions such as seeing enemies
    from far away, sensing somebody's motives, telling whether somebody is
    lying, searching a room, or listening for movement.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Stealth</b> [Mind]. Used to hide from enemies, move silently, disguise
    oneself, or steal items.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Influence</b> [Mind]. Used to intimidate, bluff, charm, negotiate,
    deceive, or coerce.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Skill Checks</h2>
  <p>
  Each of the 6 skills is associated with a certain attribute. In order to
  attempt a task based on one of the skills, a <b>skill check</b> is
  made. Sometimes a check will also be made without action on the part of the
  character in question, this is called a <b>passive</b> skill check. A skill
  check is just an attribute check for the underlying attribute of the
  skill. Each level the character has in the skill in question grants a +1 bonus
  on the check.
  </p>

  <h1>Card Types</h1>
  <p>
      Cards in DungeonStrike are the basis of the game. They are the reward for
      successful adventuring -- killing enemies results in new cards for the
      player to add to their spell deck. There are various card types present in
      the game.
  </p>
  <h2>Action Cards</h2>
  <p>
  Action cards describe the basic actions in the game. They serve as
  reminders of the possible actions which can be taken after a move, and cannot
  be discarded or interacted with in any way.
  </p>
  <div class="cardExample">
    <div class="card actionCard">
      <div class="cardCost"></div>
      <div class="cardName">Attack</div>
      <div class="cardRules">
        <p>

        deal its weapon damage to that enemy.

    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Spell Cards</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Spell</b> cards can be cast by the player by paying the
      appropriate costs during their turn, or at certain other times (See <a
      href="#-spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> for more information). Spells come
      in a variety of different types.
    </p>
  <h3>Spell <i class="dot"></i> Attack</h3>
    <p>
    Attack spells require the caster to <a href="#-hits-and-damage">roll to
    hit</a> the target before their effects resolve. The attack is always made
    at a <a href="#-range"> 1x short range</a> bonus to hit. On a miss, the
    spell has no effect.
    </p>
    <div class="cardExample">
      <div class="card fire">

  <h2>Equipment Cards</h2>
    <p>
    Equipment cards represent tools used by the character which give them
    special abilities and ongoing effects. See <a href="#-equipment">
    Equipment</a> for more information.
    </p>

  <h2>Enemy Cards</h2>
    <p>
    Enemy cards represent the various foes the player can encounter during the
    game, describing their abilities and basic statistics.
    </p>

  <h2>Character Cards</h2>
    <p>
    Character cards represent the different characters controlled
    by the player, and also display their basic statistics such as
    attribute scores.
    </p>

  <h1>Reactions and the Stack</h1>
  <p>
    When a player casts a spell, activates an activated effect, or makes an attack
    the effect does not resolve immediately. Instead, the effect is put into an
    ephemeral area called <b>the stack</b> to allow the opponent to respond.
  </p>

  <h1>Combat</h1>
  <p>
    There are two steps involved in making an attack: rolling for a hit, and
    rolling for damage.
  </p>
  <p>
      To determine if an attack is a hit, the attacker makes a standard <a
      href="#-attribute-checks">agility attribute check</a>, applying the
      various modifiers as appropriate. On success, the attack is a hit.
      If the attack is a <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">reaction
      attack</a>, the attacker takes a -4 penalty to hit. Area attacks do not
      need to roll for hits: they always hit.
  </p>
  <p>
      The effect of a hit being scored depends on the type of attack. For basic
      weapons, the weapon damage will be specified in terms of <b>damage
      dice</b> to roll to calculate damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Damage Reduction</h2>
  <p>
  Some spells and equipment like armor provide <b>damage reduction</b>. When a
  character suffers a hit, their damage reduction is subtracted from the total
  damage that is being dealt. Damage reduction can also be associated with only
  a specific type of damage, such as fire damage. For example, a character with
  a damage reduction of "-5 Fire" would only take 7 damage if struck with an
  effect which would normally deal 12 points of fire damage. It is also possible
  to have <b>damage immunity</b>, which is effectively infinite damage
  reduction.
  </p>

  <h2>Health, Unconsciousness, and Death</h2>
  <p>
  Units have two basic values called their <b>current health</b> and their
  <b>maximum health</b>. Both values are initially equal to their fortitude
  attribute. Health represents the maximum amount of damage they can sustain
  before <b>dying</b>, with current health decreasing whenever
  damage is suffered. Max health can be increased by certain spells and
  equipment, and it can also decrease, e.g. due to ability score damage. Units
  can never have more health than their maximum health, and by default when
  maximum health increases, the unit's current health increases by the same
  amount. When a unit dies, it is placed into its owner's discard pile. If the
  Champion or the Master dies, that player loses the game.
  </p>

  <h1>Spellcasting</h1>
  <p>
  Spells in DungeonStrike are represented by spell cards. Each spell card belongs
  to one of the four <b>schools</b> of magic, each associated with one of the
  four Gods: Aeris, Petra, Ignis, and Aquis, or is a <b>neutral</b> spell, equally
  accessible to any spellcaster. Each Champion must select one of the four schools
  to specialize in. Spells cast from outside the chosen school of the Champion can
  still be cast at an additional cost.
  </p>
  <p>
  All spell cards also have a <b>cost</b> printed on them, which must be paid
  before the spell can be played. The most common type of cost is a <b>mana
  cost</b>. In order to cast such a spell, the unit must spend mana equal to the
  cost from its <b>mana pool</b>. Units add 1 mana to their pool during the
  <a href="#-beginning-of-turn-step">beginning of turn step</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Spell Decks</h2>
  <p>
  Spells are drawn from a Spell Deck which is constructed before an encounter
  begins. The spell deck consists of 40 cards and cannot contain more than 4
  copies of the same card.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the spell deck is empty, no further spell cards can be drawn, but the game
  continues as normal. During the <a href="#-end-of-turn-step">end of turn
  step</a>, if the player has more than 7 cards in hand, they discard down to a
  maximum of 7 cards.
  </p>

  <h2>Effect Resolution</h2>
  <p>
  Casting a spell or activating an activated effect follows a sequence of steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The player announces which unit is casting the spell or activating the
      activated effect and the name of the effect, revealing the card if
      necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the spell offers a choice of multiple different effects, they announce
      which effect or effects will be used.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player pays any costs required. If they wish to add any optional
      effects (see <a href="#-reading-a-spell-card">Reading a Spell Card</a>),
      they announce which ones at this time and pay any costs associated with
      them as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player selects a target for the spell which meets the spell's
      targeting requirements, if any.
    </li>
    <li>
      The effect is put onto the <a href="#-reactions-and-the-stack">stack</a>
      to be eventually resolved.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
  After the stack is resolved, the text instructions on the spell card are
  followed in the order in which they are printed. Choices like targeting are
  again checked for legality, and instructions on a spell card which attempt to
  interact with no-longer-legal targets do not resolve.
  </p>

  <p>
  If two effects are created simultaneously, effects created by the active player
  go on the stack first in <b>timestamp order</b>, meaning that effects created
  by spell cards played earlier go onto the stack first. Effects created by the
  inactive player are then added to the stack in the same order.
  </p>

  <h1>Deck Building</h1>
  <p>Each player in <i>DungeonStrike</i> utilitizes a preconstructed deck of cards, which must be built according to specific deck-building rules.</p>
  <p>The Master builds a deck which consists of 60 cards. With the exception of Standard Room cards, no more than 4 copies of a card with a given name are allowed to be present in the deck. At most 3 distinct subtypes may appear on the cards in the deck.</p>
  <p>The Champion builds two decks. The Spell Deck consists of 45 Spell cards. No more than 3 copies of a card with a given name are allowed to be present in this deck, and only Spell cards associated with the school or schools of magic listed on the Champion's character card may be played.</p>
<p>The Equipment deck consists of 30 Equipment cards. No more than 2 copies of a card with a given name are allowed to be present in this deck.</p>
  <h1>Conditions</h1>
    <p>
    Spells and other effects in DungeonStrike can create a variety of
    <b>conditions</b> in their targts, either temporarily or on an ongoing
    basis. These conditions typically cause a penalty of some type. The possible
    conditions are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Anosmic</b>. Unable to smell. -8 to Agility checks if scent is
      a primary sense for the target, otherwise, -2 to Perception.</li>
      <li><b>Asleep</b>. Unable to take any action. Any stimulus (lights,
      sounds, attacks) ends this condition</li>
      <li><b>Blinded</b>. Unable to see. -8 to Agility checks if sight is a
      primary sense for the target, otherwise, -2 to Perception.</li>
      <li><b>Charmed</b>. Target is controlled by creator of the effect. -2 to
      Agility.</li>
      <li><b>Dazed</b>. Unable to spend <i class="action"></i>.</li>
      <li><b>Deafened</b>. Unable to hear. -8 to Agility checks if hearing is

      </li>
      <li><b>Frightened</b>. -2 to Mind and Agility, replaces Intimidated.
      Stacks, if target would become Intimidated or Frightened, they become
      Terrified instead.</li>
      <li><b>Frozen</b>. -2 to Agility, 1d4 cold damage per round.</li>
      <li><b>Immobilized</b>. Unable to move rooms.</li>
      <li><b>Insane</b>. Target acts randomly.</li>
      <li><b>Intimidated</b>. -1 to Mind and Agility. Stacks, if target would
      become Intimidated again, they become Frightened instead.</li>
      <li><b>Invisible</b>. Can't be seen. Enemies with sight as a primary sense
      take penalties as if Blinded when attacking.</li>
      <li><b>Mute</b>. Unable to communicate or cast spells requiring verbal
      activation words.</li>
      <li><b>On Fire</b>. -8 to Mind checks, 2d12 fire damage per round.</li>

      primary sense take penalties as if Anosmic when attacking.
      <li><b>Silent</b>. Does not produce noise. Enemies with hearing as a
      primary sense take penalties as if Deafened when attacking.</li>
      <li><b>Slowed</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Terrified</b>. -3 to Mind and Agility, replaces Intimidated and
      Frightened. Stacks, if target would become Intimidated or Frightened, they
      stay Terrified instead.
      <li><b>Unconscious</b>. Unable to take any action.</li>
      <li><b>Waterlogged</b>. Rolls to create the "On Fire" condition made at
      -4.</li>
      <li><b>Weakened</b>. -6 to Fortitude checks.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

  <h1>Equipment</h1>
  <p>
  Equipment represents the weapons, armor, and other tools that units bring with
  them into combat. Equipment cards are received as a reward for combat success
  much in the same way as spell cards, but equipment belongs to a specific unit
  and cannot be changed during gameplay, only configured outside of an
  individual encounter. Units are limited to at most one piece of equipment with
  a given equipment, except for Rings and Miscellaneous which each have 2.
  </p>
