- Import the package to a new empty unity project, or else the PoolManager
  in the demo scenes inexplicably loses its prefab instances.
- Import everything except Code/MeshCombine
- Copy folder from clean unity project into ThirdParty
- Replace CombineChildren references in "06_nebula_example" demo scene with a reference
  to the one in SciFi Rifles, because it caused name collisions. Uncheck "generate
  triangles".
