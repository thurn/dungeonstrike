- Corrected error in AssetBundleManager where WWW.error was compared to
  null. According to the docs, the empty string is sometimes returned in
  non-failure cases, and the check should use "if
  (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(download.error))"
- Added "BuildAssetBundleOptions.StrictMode" to BuildScript BuildAssetBundles
- Made BuildScript::CopyAssetBundlesTo() method public
